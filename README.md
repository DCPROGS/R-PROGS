# R-PROGS
Statistical programs in R written by David Colquhoun. Scripts were used to generate numerical examples for two papers on the interpretation of p-values. 

Scripts in RSOS directory are for a paper ['An investigation of the false discovery rate and the misinterpretation of p-values'] (http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/3/140216) published in [Royal Society Open Science] (http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/) magazine. 

Scripts in Chalkdust directory are for paper [The perils of p-values] (http://www.dcscience.net/2015/10/06/the-perils-of-p-values-in-chalkdust-magazine/) published in [Chalkdust] (http://chalkdustmagazine.com/) magazine.

Equivalent calculations in Python are shown in notebooks in pyScripts folder.
